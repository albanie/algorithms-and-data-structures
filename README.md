# Introduction to data structures and algorithms

This repo aims to provide minimalist implementations of data structures and algorithms in Python. The bare necessities. Each data structure is accompanied by a video lecture (and pdf slides).

## Data structures

### Hash Tables

## Further resources

### Open source books/code

- :green_book: [algorithms.wtf](http://algorithms.wtf/) by Jeff Erickson
- :green_book: + :hammer: [A First Course on Data Structures in Python & the ds2 library](https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures) by Don Sheehy
- :green_book: + :hammer: [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python (book & code)](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/index.html) by Brad Miller and David Ranum

### Further books

Unlike the options above, the resources listed below are not free. However, they represent (in my opinion) high-quality learning materials. If you have a local library, it's worth checking in case they have a copy.

- :orange_book: [Introduction to Algorithms (4th Ed.)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/) by Thomas H. Cormen et al.
